# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## **Overview of Project**

The purpose of this analysis is to conduct a Database analysis for Pewlett Hackard with detailed information on the number of future retirees from all departments currently working at the company to be able to prepare a plan to hire new staff and also to prepare a mentorship initiative. 

The criterion was based on the birth dates ranging from 1952 to 1955 and hired dates from 1985 to 1988.


## Results

## Summary

- At the moment at Pewlett Hackard, **64%** of their employees are getting ready for retirement or being redirected to their mentorship initiatives, which will mean that they are likely going to need an extensive hiring process in the upcoming years. Since a significant amount of future retirees hold Senior positions the mentorship program should provide a capacitation buffer for the extensive expertise that will be leaving the company in the years to come.
